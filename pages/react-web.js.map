the `Animated`\n\t * library is designed to make them fluid, powerful, and easy to build and\n\t * maintain.\n\t *\n\t * The simplest workflow is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or\n\t * more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates either\n\t * via animations, such as `Animated.timing`, or by hooking into gestures like\n\t * panning or scolling via `Animated.event`.  `Animated.Value` can also bind to\n\t * props other than style, and can be interpolated as well.  Here is a basic\n\t * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n\t *\n\t *```javascript\n\t *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n\t *    constructor(props) {\n\t *      super(props);\n\t *      this.state = {\n\t *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n\t *      };\n\t *    }\n\t *    componentDidMount() {\n\t *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n\t *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n\t *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n\t *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n\t *    }\n\t *    render() {\n\t *      return (\n\t *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n\t *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n\t *          {this.props.children}\n\t *        </Animated.View>\n\t *      );\n\t *    }\n\t *  }\n\t *```\n\t *\n\t * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n\t * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n\t * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n\t * the animated values to the properties, and do targetted native updates to\n\t * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n\t * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n\t *\n\t * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n\t * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n\t * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n\t *\n\t * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n\t * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n\t * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n\t * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n\t * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n\t *\n\t * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n\t * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n\t * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n\t *\n\t *```javascript\n\t *  style={{\n\t *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n\t *    transform: [{\n\t *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n\t *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n\t *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n\t *      }),\n\t *    }],\n\t *  }}>\n\t *```\n\t *\n\t * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n\t * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n\t * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n\t *\n\t * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n\t * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n\t * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n\t *\n\t * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n\t * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html).\n\t *\n\t * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n\t * can be run in a high performace way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n\t * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n\t * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n\t * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n\t * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n\t * implications in the future.\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = {\n\t  /**\n\t   * Standard value class for driving animations.

There should be a\n\t * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n\t * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the elemement, it should\n\t * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n\t * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n\t * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n\t * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n\t * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n\t *\n\t * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n\t * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n\t *\n\t * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n\t *\n\t *   getInitialState: function() {\n\t *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n\t *   }\n\t *\n\t * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n\t *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n\t *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node who's\n\t *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n\t *\n\t *   // In render function:\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <div\n\t *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n\t *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n\t *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n\t *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n\t *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n\t *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n\t *       <div>\n\t *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n\t *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n\t *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   );\n\t *\n\t * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n\t *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n\t *\n\t * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n\t *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n\t *   that you should implement.\n\t *\n\t *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n\t *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n\t *   },\n\t *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n\t *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n\t *   },\n\t *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n\t *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n\t *   },\n\t *\n\t * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n\t *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n\t *     return 20;\n\t *   }\n\t *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n\t *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n\t *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n\t *   }\n\t */\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Touchable states.\n\t */\n\tvar States = (0, _keyMirror2['default'])({\n\t  NOT_RESPONDER:

The reasoning is that a\n\t *   platform scroll view that isn't built on top of the responder system has\n\t *   began scrolling, and the active responder must now be notified that the\n\t *   interaction is no longer locked to it - the system has taken over.\n\t *\n\t * - Responder being released:\n\t *   As soon as no more touches that *started* inside of descendents of the\n\t *   *current* responderID, an `onResponderRelease` event is dispatched to the\n\t *   current responder, and the responder lock is released.\n\t *\n\t * TODO:\n\t * - on \"end\", a callback hook for `onResponderEndShouldRemainResponder` that\n\t *   determines if the responder lock should remain.\n\t * - If a view shouldn't \"remain\" the responder, any active touches should by\n\t *   default be considered \"dead\" and do not influence future negotiations or\n\t *   bubble paths. It should be as if those touches do not exist.\n\t * -- For multitouch: Usually a translate-z will choose to \"remain\" responder\n\t *  after one out of many touches ended. For translate-y, usually the view\n\t *  doesn't wish to \"remain\" responder after one of many touches end.\n\t * - Consider building this on top of a `stopPropagation` model similar to\n\t *   `W3C` events.\n\t * - Ensure that `onResponderTerminate` is called on touch cancels, whether or\n\t *   not `onResponderTerminationRequest` returns `true` or `false`.\n\t *\n\t */\n\t\n\t/*

about event ordering in the `EventPluginHub`.\n\t *\n\t * Suppose plugins are injected in the following order:\n\t *\n\t * `[R, S, C]`\n\t *\n\t * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n\t * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n\t *\n\t * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n\t *\n\t * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n\t *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n\t *   `extractEvents()`.\n\t * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n\t *   dispatched events\".\n\t * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n\t *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n\t * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n\t *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n\t *   name deferred).\n\t *\n\t * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n\t * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n\t * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n\t * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n\t * in the first place.\n\t *\n\t * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n\t *\n\t * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n\t * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n\t *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n\t * - They should not have side effects.\n\t * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n\t *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n\t *   extraction.\n\t *\n\t * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n\t *\n\t * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n\t * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n\t * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n\t * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t *\n\t * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n\t * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n\t * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n\t * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n\t * will appear as follows:\n\t *\n\t * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n\t * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t *\n\t * @param {string} topLevelType Record from `EventConstants`.\n\t * @param {string} topLevelTargetID ID of deepest React rendered element.\n\t * @param {object} nativeEvent Native browser event.\n\t * @return {*} An accumulation of synthetic events.\n\t */\n\tfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, topLevelTargetID, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n\t  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === EventConstants.topLevelTypes.topSelectionChange ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\t\n\t  // TODO: stop one short of the the current responder.\n\t  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderID ? topLevelTargetID : ReactInstanceHandles.getFirstCommonAncestorID(responderID, topLevelTargetID);\n\t\n\t  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n\t  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.

The keyboard callbacks\n\t * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n\t * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n\t * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n\t * the time the props callbacks are invoke.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n\t   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n\t   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n\t   *\n\t   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n\t   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n\t   *     }\n\t   *\n\t   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   */\n\t  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n\t      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\t      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t        return true;\n\t      }\n\t      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    return false;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJS(json, converter) {\n\t    return converter ?\n\t      fromJSWith(converter, json, '', {'': json}) :\n\t      fromJSDefault(json);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJSWith(converter, json, key, parentJSON) {\n\t    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n\t      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, IndexedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n\t    }\n\t    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n\t      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, KeyedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n\t    }\n\t    return json;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function fromJSDefault(json) {\n\t    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n\t      return IndexedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toList();\n\t    }\n\t    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n\t      return KeyedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toMap();\n\t    }\n\t    return json;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function isPlainObj(value) {\n\t    return value && (value.constructor === Object || value.constructor === undefined);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var src_Math__imul =\n\t    typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?\n\t    Math.imul :\n\t    function imul(a, b) {\n\t      a = a | 0; // int\n\t      b = b | 0; // int\n\t      var c = a & 0xffff;\n\t      var d = b & 0xffff;\n\t      // Shift by 0 fixes the sign on the high part.\n\t      return (c * d) + ((((a >>> 16) * d + c * (b >>> 16)) << 16) >>> 0) | 0; // int\n\t    };\n\t\n\t  // v8 has an optimization for storing 31-bit signed numbers.\n\t  // Values which have either 00 or 11 as the high order bits qualify.\n\t  // This function drops the highest order bit in a signed number, maintaining\n\t  // the sign bit.\n\t  function smi(i32) {\n\t    return ((i32 >>> 1) & 0x40000000) | (i32 & 0xBFFFFFFF);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function hash(o) {\n\t    if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n\t      return 0;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof o.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      o = o.valueOf();\n\t      if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n\t        return 0;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (o === true) {\n\t      return 1;\n\t    }\n\t    var type = typeof o;\n\t    if (type === 'number') {\n\t      var h = o | 0;\n\t      if (h !== o) {\n\t        h ^= o * 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\t      }\n\t      while (o > 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n\t        o /= 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\t        h ^= o;\n\t      }\n\t      return smi(h);\n\t    }\n\t    if (type === 'string') {\n\t      return o.length > STRING_HASH_CACHE_MIN_STRLEN ? cachedHashString(o) : hashString(o);\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof o.hashCode === 'function') {\n\t      return o.hashCode();\n\t    }\n\t    return hashJSObj(o);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function cachedHashString(string) {\n\t    var hash = stringHashCache[string];\n\t    if (hash === undefined) {\n\t      hash = hashString(string);\n\t      if (STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE === STRING_HASH_CACHE_MAX_SIZE) {\n\t        STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE = 0;\n\t        stringHashCache = {};\n\t      }\n\t      STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE++;\n\t      stringHashCache[string] = hash;\n\t    }\n\t    return hash;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  // http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings\n\t  function hashString(string) {\n\t    // This is the hash from JVM\n\t    // The hash code for a string is computed as\n\t    // s[0] * 31 ^ (n - 1) + s[1] * 31 ^ (n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1],\n\t    // where s[i] is the ith character of the string and n is the length of\n\t    // the string.

works on all the devices independent of their\n\t * pixel density.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * style={{ borderWidth: 1 / PixelRatio.get() }}\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * ### Fetching a correctly sized image\n\t *\n\t * You should get a higher resolution image if you are on a high pixel density\n\t * device. A good rule of thumb is to multiply the size of the image you display\n\t * by the pixel ratio.\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * var image = getImage({\n\t *   width: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(200),\n\t *   height: PixelRatio.getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(100),\n\t * });\n\t * <Image source={image} style={{width: 200, height: 100}} />\n\t * ```\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar PixelRatio = (function () {\n\t  function PixelRatio() {\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, PixelRatio);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  _createClass(PixelRatio, null, [{\n\t    key: 'get',\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     * Returns the device pixel density.

It's now been adopted by several other Android\n\t// applications. This JavaScript port was written to provide a quick\n\t// way to demonstrate Rebound animations on the web for a\n\t// [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5kNm-DgyjY). Since then\n\t// the JavaScript version has been used to build some really nice interfaces.\n\t// Check out [brandonwalkin.com](http://brandonwalkin.com) for an\n\t// example.\n\t//\n\t// Overview\n\t// --------\n\t// The Library provides a SpringSystem for maintaining a set of Spring\n\t// objects and iterating those Springs through a physics solver loop\n\t// until equilibrium is achieved. The Spring class is the basic\n\t// animation driver provided by Rebound. By attaching a listener to\n\t// a Spring, you can observe its motion. The observer function is\n\t// notified of position changes on the spring as it solves for\n\t// equilibrium. These position updates can be mapped to an animation\n\t// range to drive animated property updates on your user interface\n\t// elements (translation, rotation, scale, etc).\n\t//\n\t// Example\n\t// -------\n\t// Here's a simple example.

Here is a basic\n * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n *    constructor(props) {\n *      super(props);\n *      this.state = {\n *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n *      };\n *    }\n *    componentDidMount() {\n *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n *    }\n *    render() {\n *      return (\n *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n *          {this.props.children}\n *        </Animated.View>\n *      );\n *    }\n *  }\n *```\n *\n * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n * the animated values to the properties, and do targetted native updates to\n * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n *\n * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n *\n * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n *\n * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  style={{\n *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n *    transform: [{\n *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n *      }),\n *    }],\n *  }}>\n *```\n *\n * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n *\n * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n *\n * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animations.html).\n *\n * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n * can be run in a high performace way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n * implications in the future.\n */\nmodule.exports = {\n  /**\n   * Standard value class for driving animations.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the elemement, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node who's\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <div\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <div>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </div>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to

{\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *

of deferred dispatches.\n * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n *   name deferred).\n *\n * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n *\n * @param {string} topLevelType Record from `EventConstants`.\n * @param {string} topLevelTargetID ID of deepest React rendered element.\n * @param {object} nativeEvent Native browser event.\n * @return {*} An accumulation of synthetic events.\n */\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, topLevelTargetID, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === EventConstants.topLevelTypes.topSelectionChange ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  // TODO: stop one short of the the current responder.\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderID ? topLevelTargetID : ReactInstanceHandles.getFirstCommonAncestorID(responderID, topLevelTargetID);\n\n  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.

A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n *\n * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n * whether to re-render it or not.\n *\n * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n * it.\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n *   return {ds};\n * },\n * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n *   this.setState({\n *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n */\n\nclass ListViewDataSource {\n\n  /**\n   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n   * headers and rows.

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function fromJS(json, converter) {\n    return converter ?\n      fromJSWith(converter, json, '', {'': json}) :\n      fromJSDefault(json);\n  }\n\n  function fromJSWith(converter, json, key, parentJSON) {\n    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, IndexedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n    }\n    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n      return converter.call(parentJSON, key, KeyedSeq(json).map(function(v, k)  {return fromJSWith(converter, v, k, json)}));\n    }\n    return json;\n  }\n\n  function fromJSDefault(json) {\n    if (Array.isArray(json)) {\n      return IndexedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toList();\n    }\n    if (isPlainObj(json)) {\n      return KeyedSeq(json).map(fromJSDefault).toMap();\n    }\n    return json;\n  }\n\n  function isPlainObj(value) {\n    return value && (value.constructor === Object || value.constructor === undefined);\n  }\n\n  var src_Math__imul =\n    typeof Math.imul === 'function' && Math.imul(0xffffffff, 2) === -2 ?\n    Math.imul :\n    function imul(a, b) {\n      a = a | 0; // int\n      b = b | 0; // int\n      var c = a & 0xffff;\n      var d = b & 0xffff;\n      // Shift by 0 fixes the sign on the high part.\n      return (c * d) + ((((a >>> 16) * d + c * (b >>> 16)) << 16) >>> 0) | 0; // int\n    };\n\n  // v8 has an optimization for storing 31-bit signed numbers.\n  // Values which have either 00 or 11 as the high order bits qualify.\n  // This function drops the highest order bit in a signed number, maintaining\n  // the sign bit.\n  function smi(i32) {\n    return ((i32 >>> 1) & 0x40000000) | (i32 & 0xBFFFFFFF);\n  }\n\n  function hash(o) {\n    if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n      return 0;\n    }\n    if (typeof o.valueOf === 'function') {\n      o = o.valueOf();\n      if (o === false || o === null || o === undefined) {\n        return 0;\n      }\n    }\n    if (o === true) {\n      return 1;\n    }\n    var type = typeof o;\n    if (type === 'number') {\n      var h = o | 0;\n      if (h !== o) {\n        h ^= o * 0xFFFFFFFF;\n      }\n      while (o > 0xFFFFFFFF) {\n        o /= 0xFFFFFFFF;\n        h ^= o;\n      }\n      return smi(h);\n    }\n    if (type === 'string') {\n      return o.length > STRING_HASH_CACHE_MIN_STRLEN ? cachedHashString(o) : hashString(o);\n    }\n    if (typeof o.hashCode === 'function') {\n      return o.hashCode();\n    }\n    return hashJSObj(o);\n  }\n\n  function cachedHashString(string) {\n    var hash = stringHashCache[string];\n    if (hash === undefined) {\n      hash = hashString(string);\n      if (STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE === STRING_HASH_CACHE_MAX_SIZE) {\n        STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE = 0;\n        stringHashCache = {};\n      }\n      STRING_HASH_CACHE_SIZE++;\n      stringHashCache[string] = hash;\n    }\n    return hash;\n  }\n\n  // http://jsperf.com/hashing-strings\n  function hashString(string) {\n    // This is the hash from JVM\n    // The hash code for a string is computed as\n    // s[0] * 31 ^ (n - 1) + s[1] * 31 ^ (n - 2) + ... + s[n - 1],\n    // where s[i] is the ith character of the string and n is the length of\n    // the string.

It's now been adopted by several other Android\n// applications. This JavaScript port was written to provide a quick\n// way to demonstrate Rebound animations on the web for a\n// [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5kNm-DgyjY). Since then\n// the JavaScript version has been used to build some really nice interfaces.\n// Check out [brandonwalkin.com](http://brandonwalkin.com) for an\n// example.\n//\n// Overview\n// --------\n// The Library provides a SpringSystem for maintaining a set of Spring\n// objects and iterating those Springs through a physics solver loop\n// until equilibrium is achieved. The Spring class is the basic\n// animation driver provided by Rebound. By attaching a listener to\n// a Spring, you can observe its motion.
